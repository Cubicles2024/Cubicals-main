```

## Starting the Application

### 1. Start Backend Server
```bash
# In the backend directory
cd backend

# Start development server
npm run dev

# The server should start on port 3000 (or the port specified in your .env)
# You should see a message like: "Server running on port 3000"
# Database connection message: "Connected to MongoDB successfully"
```

### 2. Start Frontend Application
```bash
# Open a new terminal window/tab
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Run the super user creation script
node createSuperUser.js

# You will be prompted to enter:
# - Email
# - Password
# - Name
# Or these details might be preset in the script

# Upon success, you should see: "Super User created successfully"
```

### Accessing Super User Dashboard

   - Check MongoDB connection
   - Verify all environment variables are set correctly
   - Check for port conflicts (something else might be using port 3000)

2. **Frontend won't start:**
   - Check for Node.js version compatibility
   - Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
   - Delete node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

3. **API Connection Errors:**
   - Ensure backend is running
   - Check CORS configuration in backend
   - Verify API URL in frontend .env file

4. **Login Issues:**
   - Check if JWT secret is properly set
   - Verify user exists in database
   - Check browser console for errors
