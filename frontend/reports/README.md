# Test Reports Directory

This directory contains automated test reports generated by Vitest:

- `test-results.json` - JSON format test results
- `test-results.html` - HTML format test results
- `coverage/` - Test coverage reports

## Generating Reports

Run the following commands to generate reports:

These reports are gitignored but this README.md file ensures the directory structure is preserved.
